# Portfolio Website
## Introduction
This is a simple website (deployed) to showcase my current skills during my software development journey. As of right now, the website is a simple
HTML and CSS website. This is planned to be changed in the future as I plan to implement more design and functionality aspects to the page. The live website can be found [here](williamandrews.net).

## Layout
The layout is simple, with each section having its respective card classes. Images have been compressed to .webp formats to decrease the page loading time
and increase overall performance. CSS has also been optimized to increase performance. 

## Known Issues
* Need to resize logos at the bottom of the page on the last card?
