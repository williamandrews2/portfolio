                <h1>Allow me to introduce myself.</h1>
                
                <p>I am a self-motivated Computer Science graduate from the University of Texas at Tyler, 
                    where I earned my degree in May 2024. I am proficient in programming languages such as 
                    JavaScript, C, Java, HTML, CSS, and Unity/C#, with a particular focus on web development. 
                    Throughout my four-year academic journey, I had the opportunity to collaborate with 
                    talented peers on various projects. These experiences have been instrumental in my 
                    personal and intellectual growth, reinforcing my dedication to continuous learning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My career aspirations revolve around securing a position in web development, 
                    while remaining receptive to other promising avenues within the realm of 
                    software development. I am unwavering in my commitment to continuous learning 
                    and will go to great lengths to consistently deliver work of the utmost quality.
                     Challenges are not obstacles, but rather opportunities that I wholeheartedly embrace. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my spare time, I find great pleasure in the duality of my interests. Coding and 
                    learning serve as a constant source of intellectual engagement, allowing me to 
                    explore the ever-evolving world of technology. Simultaneously, I enjoy the 
                    opportunity to balance this with the camaraderie of my friends, often attending 
                    car events where our shared passion for automotive culture flourishes. This unique 
                    blend of pursuits grants me a well-rounded and fulfilling leisure experience, 
                    supporting both my analytical and social dimensions. 
                </p>
