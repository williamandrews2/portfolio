                <h1>Allow me to introduce myself.</h1>
                
                <p>I am a self-driven Computer Science student at the University of Texas at Tyler, 
                    on track to graduate in May 2024. My proficiency extends to programming languages 
                    such as Java, C, Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a particular focus on 
                    web development. Over the course of my three-year academic journey, I have had 
                    the privilege of engaging with accomplished peers and participating in 
                    collaborative projects. This invaluable experience has significantly contributed 
                    to my ongoing personal and intellectual development, fortifying my unwavering 
                    commitment to the pursuit of knowledge. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    My career aspirations revolve around securing a position in web development, 
                    while remaining receptive to other promising avenues within the realm of 
                    software development. I am unwavering in my commitment to continuous learning 
                    and will go to great lengths to consistently deliver work of the utmost quality.
                     Challenges are not obstacles, but rather opportunities that I wholeheartedly embrace. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my spare time, I find great pleasure in the duality of my interests. Coding and 
                    learning serve as a constant source of intellectual engagement, allowing me to 
                    explore the ever-evolving world of technology. Simultaneously, I enjoy the 
                    opportunity to balance this with the camaraderie of my friends, often attending 
                    car events where our shared passion for automotive culture flourishes. This unique 
                    blend of pursuits grants me a well-rounded and fulfilling leisure experience, 
                    supporting both my analytical and social dimensions.
