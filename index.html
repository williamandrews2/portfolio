                <h1>Allow me to introduce myself.</h1>
                
                <p>I’m a self-driven software developer with over three years of hands-on 
                    experience building user interfaces, web applications, and interactive
                     software using technologies like ReactJS, JavaScript, Unity/C#, and 
                     modern development tools such as Webpack, Vite, and Git. I graduated 
                     with a B.S. in Computer Science from the University of Texas at Tyler 
                     in May 2024, and since then, I've continued refining my skills through 
                     both professional work and personal projects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I’m especially passionate about front-end development and creating intuitive,
                     maintainable user experiences — but I’m always open to expanding into 
                     new areas of software development. Whether I’m collaborating on team-based 
                     projects or working independently, I’m dedicated to continuous learning 
                     and delivering high-quality, thoughtful solutions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Outside of coding, I enjoy balancing my technical curiosity with social 
                    and creative pursuits. You’ll often find me learning new technology or
                     building out a project (usually both) — and just as often, connecting 
                    with friends and enjoying the vibrant community around
                     automotive culture. It’s this blend of focus and balance that drives 
                     both my professional growth and personal fulfillment.
                </p>
