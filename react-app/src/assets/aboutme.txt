I'm a software developer with over three years of
                        experience building web interfaces and interactive
                        applications. I earned my B.S. in Computer Science from
                        the University of Texas at Tyler in 2024 and have
                        continued to grow through both work and personal
                        projects.

                        I'm passionate about front-end development and crafting
                        clean, intuitive user experiences, while always staying
                        open to learning new technologies and approaches.

                        Outside of coding, I enjoy car culture, creative
                        projects, and staying connected with friends â€” a balance
                        that fuels both my work and personal growth.
